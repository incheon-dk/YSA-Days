Got a call from a source, one normally tries to avoid.

The Stake Presidency of the BYU Young Singles Adult Stake wanted to meet one Saturday afternoon.

However, upon meeting a Stake Presidency member, we listened to the role.

We deliberated and took it.

Next day, we attended the Ward and we were sustained and set apart.

Thus began a 5 year journey

That was August of 2017
