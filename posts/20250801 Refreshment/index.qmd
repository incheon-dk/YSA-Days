A sister from HK, upon seeing the food, remarked.

> It is real food.

The food was simple, modern version of 비빔밥.

Think she was expecting some refreshment instead.

Growing up, gathering meant food.

More exquisite the food, more special the gathering

When does refreshment become a nourishment.

Can nourishment turn into a renewal of the body and spirit.

And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.

But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.

Matthew 4:3,4
