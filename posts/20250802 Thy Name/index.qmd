Korean names were no issue, even if they had a double character name like **남궁** or **제갈**, I could remember them

Chinese surnames were bit more challenging.

林 can be pronounced either, Lim / Im / Lam / Lin depending on the location within Asia.

Visits to Taiwan, China, HK, and Singapore had prepared me.

Likewise, 陳 can be Tran, Chen, Chin, Chan, Chun or Tan

Japanese would have been more challenging.

Except I had been working with Japanese company for the past 5 years.

I had learned to distinguish the given name from the family name.

And understood some of the Kanji that defined the 2 character surnames.

Phillipines was easy, familiar and short

Mongolia wasn't. Long and unfamiliar
